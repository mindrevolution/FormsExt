# FormsExt for Umbraco Forms

FormsExt extends Umbraco Forms with Fieldtypes and Workflows, especially newsletter opt-in and marketing automation glue.


## Clone and build

> *You have been warned:* This package is a work in progress while I merge in features from several websites and internal packages made by mindrevolution.

* Umbraco 7.4+
* Umbraco Forms 4.1+
* Visual Studio 2015 (or above)


	#### build an Umbraco package in *../dist*
	```
	git clone https://github.com/mindrevolution/FormsExt.git
	cd FormsExt
	.\build.cmd
	```

If you prefer to have a local test site and easy development, drop a current Umbraco release into */www*.

## Umbraco package (repository)

It's not there yet, but the build generates an Umbraco package already, so feel free to pick that up on the releases page.
